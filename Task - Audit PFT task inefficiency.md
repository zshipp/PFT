# PFT Network Task Submission Optimization Guide

Date: October 29, 2024

## System Understanding

### Verification Tiers

- **Tier 1 (100% Reward)**
    - Automatically verifiable outputs
    - GitHub commit links
    - Blockchain transactions
    - Discord image links (when properly formatted)
- **Tier 2 (80% Reward)**
    - Internal documentation
    - Private repository content
- **Tier 3 (50% Reward)**
    - Manual verification
    - Description-based proof

### Key Success Factors

1. Clean execution (no flags) is more valuable than PFT rewards
2. Verification responses must stay under 900 characters
3. Image verification requires specific Discord link format
4. GitHub documentation preferred for Tier 1 classification

## Optimization Strategy

### Documentation Setup

1. **GitHub Repository Structure**
    - Create dedicated repository for task documentation
    - Use consistent folder structure for different task types
    - Ensure public accessibility for verification
2. **Image Handling Process**
    - Post images to Discord first
    - Right-click and copy image link
    - Include link in verification response

### Verification Response Template


[TIMESTAMP] Task completion evidence:
1. Primary verification: [GITHUB_LINK]
2. Supporting documentation: [Additional_Links]
3. Image proof (if required): [DISCORD_IMAGE_LINK]

Key deliverable summary: [1-2 sentences]

Reference: [SUBMISSION_ID]

## Implementation Steps

### Pre-Task Preparation

1. Set up GitHub repository if not already done
2. Create task-specific folder
3. Review verification requirements

### During Task Execution

1. Document work directly in GitHub
2. Capture required screenshots
3. Upload images to Discord immediately
4. Copy Discord image links
5. Make GitHub commits with clear messages

### Submission Process

1. **Verification Response Creation**
    - Start with timestamp
    - Include GitHub commit link as primary proof
    - Add Discord image links if required
    - Keep under 900 characters
    - Reference submission ID
2. **Final Checks**
    - Verify all links are accessible
    - Confirm GitHub commits are public
    - Check character count
    - Review for any potential flag triggers

### Quality Assurance

- Double-check link accessibility
- Ensure documentation is public
- Verify image links work
- Confirm character count is under limit

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Relying on internal documentation (Tier 2) when GitHub (Tier 1) is available
2. Exceeding character limit
3. Using incorrect image link formats
4. Incomplete timestamp documentation
5. Private repository links

## Flag Prevention

- Maintain detailed documentation
- Provide clear verification paths
- Use standardized formats
- Ensure all links are accessible
- Submit complete verification responses

## Success Metrics

1. Achieving Tier 1 verification consistently
2. Zero yellow/red flags
3. Maximum reward allocation
4. Clean execution record
5. Efficient documentation process

Remember: Clean execution without flags is more valuable than maximizing individual task PFT rewards.
